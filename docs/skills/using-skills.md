## Installing Skills

### Proxify skills (this repo)

```bash
# Install all Proxify skills
npx skills add proxify-dev/Claude-Code

# Install a specific skill
npx skills add proxify-dev/Claude-Code@skill-architecture
npx skills add proxify-dev/Claude-Code@agent-development
```

### Community skills

```bash
# Browse available skills
npx skills search <keyword>

# Install from any public repo
npx skills add owner/repo
npx skills add owner/repo@specific-skill
```

Skills install to `~/.claude/skills/<name>/` (global) or `.claude/skills/<name>/` (project-level). After installing, the skill is active in all Claude Code sessions.

:::tip[Where they go]
Global skills are always available. Project-level skills only activate when you're in that directory — useful for team-specific knowledge.

## Browsing Available Skills
