## The Context Window

Claude Code has a large context window — but it's shared across everything:

| Source | Cost |
|--------|------|
| System prompt | Fixed (~50 instructions) |
| CLAUDE.md files | Fixed (loaded at launch) |
| Active skill content | Pay-per-use (loads on trigger) |
| Conversation history | Growing (accumulates over time) |
| Tool results | Variable (file reads, command output, search) |

As the window fills, older messages get compressed automatically. But you can manage this proactively.

## `/compact`

When the conversation gets long or unfocused, run `/compact`. It:
- Summarizes the conversation so far
- Frees context for new work
- Re-injects CLAUDE.md from disk (so your instructions survive)

:::tip
**Use it between tasks.** Finished a bug fix and moving to a new feature? Compact first.

## `@imports` in CLAUDE.md

The `@path/to/file` syntax in CLAUDE.md enables inline file expansion. Use it for detailed docs that shouldn't be in the main CLAUDE.md body:

```markdown
## Reference Documents
### API Architecture — `@docs/api-architecture.md`
**Read when:** Adding or modifying API endpoints
```

This keeps CLAUDE.md lean while making deep docs accessible on demand. Supports up to 5 hops of recursion.

## Large Codebases

- **Break work into focused sessions.** Don't try to refactor 20 files in one conversation.
- **Point Claude to specific files.** "Look at `src/auth/middleware.ts`" beats "find the auth code."
- **Use agents for exploration.** The Explore agent reads many files without polluting your main context.
- **Commit between tasks.** Gives you a clean rollback point and lets you `/compact` without losing work.

## Signs You're Running Low

- Claude starts forgetting earlier instructions or decisions
- Responses become less specific or repeat generic advice
- Claude asks questions you already answered
- Tool results are getting truncated

When you notice these, `/compact` and refocus.

## The Token Budget Mental Model

Think of context as a budget:

- **Cheapest:** CLAUDE.md pointers and skills (fixed cost, high leverage)
- **Mid:** Targeted file reads (pay once per read)
- **Expensive:** Pasting large files into the chat (burns fast, not reusable)

The goal is to front-load context efficiently at launch and let skills handle the rest on demand.
